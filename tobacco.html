        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
        <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The purpose of this report is to document my efforts of injecting DNA into
          tobacco plants. Injecting plants, specifically genetically modifying them through the process of genetic
          engineering, holds various possibilities and potential applications such as enhanced crop traits, improved
          nutritional content, environmental adaptation, pharmaceutical production, biofuel production, and aesthetic
          modifications.</p>

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p class='text-alignment-center' style="font-size:1.5vw"> This experiment was carried out in order to learn about genetic modification
          of plants in order to grow more favorable crops. Cultivating genes through growing flavors in an agar gel and
          then injecting leaves with solution through agroinfiltration will be incredibly useful in changing the flavor
          profile of plants while still receiving the nutrients of that plant. When the plants show red spots then it
          will signify that the experiment worked.</p>

        <h1>Project Analysis</h1>
        <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Contributing problems to plant growth are diseases,pests,and low yield. Elements from other genes can be added to the plants in order to enhance them like vanilla compounds or other flavors. By
          altering the DNA of the plant we will be able to grow and selective breed for the best kind and maximize the yield of good,healthy crops. </p>

          <h1>Methods</h1>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Prepare the Agrobacterium culture: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a common
            bacterium used in agroinfiltration. It carries a plasmid (a small DNA molecule) containing the gene of
            interest, in this case, the gene responsible for the production of vanilla flavor compounds. The bacteria
            are grown in agar gel.</p>

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Materials needed:
            Vanilla agrobacterium, pipettes, a needle-less syringe, clean healthy tobacco plant, 50mL plastic vials and 15 mL
            vials, agar gel with bacterium,and an inoculating loop. Injecting vanilla into tobacco leaves would involve a
            process known as agroinfiltration or leaf infiltration.</p> 
              <img src="Tobacco-materials.png" alt="tobaccomaterials" width="200" height="200" class="center">

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Prepare the tobacco leaves: Healthy tobacco leaves are selected for
            infiltration. They should be young and free from damage or disease.The Agrobacterium culture is collected by
            growing in an agar gel for 16-18 hrs</p>
            <img src="agargel.png" alt="agargel" width="200" height="200" class="center">

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Infiltration procedure: Fill a 50mL tube with tap water. Then, pipette 1mL
            of media into 50 mL tube of tapwater. Then take a syringe and take 4mL of solution into a 15 mL clean and
            empty tube. Put the rest of the solution in the fridge. Then gently scrape bacteria off the agar gel with
            inoculating loop. Gently mix in the solution and make sure there are no clumps. </p>

        <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">Take 0.5mL in agrobacterium
            solution using a needle-less syringe. Inject the solution into the leaf tissue through stomata or by
            creating small wounds on the under-side of the leaf surface avoiding any veins. This is called agroinfiltration.</p>
            <img src="agroinfiltration.png" alt="agroinfiltration" width="200" height="200" class="center">

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> Incubation and growth: After infiltration, the tobacco plants are typically
            kept under controlled conditions, such as a growth chamber or greenhouse, for 2-7 days to allow the Agrobacterium to
            transfer the desired gene into the plant cells and for the production of vanilla flavor compounds.</p>

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">  The introduction of vanilla genes into tobacco leaves may have regulatory and
            ethical considerations that need to be taken into account.</p>

          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">Notice how the solution has spread out into the stomata! Plants should
              grow with red spots on them which will show that the agrinfiltration was succesful. Here is my peer's tobacco plant.</p>

          <p class="text-alignment-center"style="font-size:1.5vw"> My tobacco plant unfortunately did not survive. It is possible that the
              plant was not healthy enough to withstand any light bruising. The temp in my room was also too high so it may
              have contributed to it. </p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The experiment is easy to replicate if the solution is correctly injected
              into the stomata of the leaves. My plants did not survive possibly from the room temp, plant health, or
              maybe the infiltration was done incorrectly.</p>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The experiment brings up questions on the ethics of this practice.
              Environmental Impact: One ethical concern is the potential impact of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
              on the environment. There may be concerns about unintended effects on ecosystems, such as the unintended
              disruption of other organisms in the environment.

              Health and Safety: The safety of genetically modified plants for human consumption is another ethical
              consideration. Extensive testing and rigorous regulatory frameworks are typically in place to ensure the
              safety of genetically modified crops before they are approved for commercial use.

        <h1>Solutions</h1>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> If my room was more temperature controlled and my plant was healthy
                perhaps it would have been successful. </p>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
                Public Perception and Transparency: Ethical considerations also include public perception and
                transparency regarding the use of genetic modification techniques. Public engagement, education, and
                open dialogue about the benefits, risks, and ethical implications of these technologies are important to
                ensure informed decision-making and public trust.</p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> What have we learned? </p>
          <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
            DNA analysis can be used for studying the
              genetic diversity of a plant and selectively breeding for the desired outcomes. For example we can
              study the genes responsible for flavor, aroma, and other quality attributes in strawberries. By
              identifying the genetic factors that contribute to desirable taste and sensory characteristics,
              breeders can select parent strawberry plants with the desired traits to develop new varieties with enhanced
              flavor and overall fruit quality. </p>
