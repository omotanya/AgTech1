      <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
      <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
The purpose of this report is to document the design process of building out a sustainable hydroponics system.
I decided to  grow red clover in a flood and drain system which will help to address the problem of hormonal imbalance which is a contributing factor to PMS, PMDD, and menopause.

      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <p class= 'text-alignment-center' style="font-size:1.5vw"> 75% of women including myself have experienced some form of unpleasant symptoms once every month and there does not seem to be as much care and attention given to it. It is just seen as something we have to endure. I want to create a farm system that will help to address this issue and will help to reduce the number of women who struggle with hormonal changes that lead to PMS, PMDD, menopause, post-monopause, etc.</p>
      <p class= 'text-alignment-center'style="font-size:1.5vw">
The problem is that women who menstruate are experiencing this very often and it does affect our daily living. Red clover is used for perimenopause, and it's also a great herb for PMS. It has a modulating (balancing) effect on hormone levels all through life, making it a great option if you suffer from PMS. Its balancing ability is partly due to its high isoflavone content. Red clover also supports the lymphatic system, which can help with irritated skin and skin prone to breakouts.</p>

      <p class= 'text-alignment-center' style="font-size:1.5vw">
d. What factors should be considered in developing a recommendation? The factors that I took into consideration were the size of my space, aesthetics, replicability, affordability, amount of labor, and convenience. The amount of light the crop needed was important as well.</p>
      <p class= 'text-alignment-center' style="font-size:1.5vw">
d. What recommendations are you making? I am making a simple flood drain system. That will grow 4 trays of red clover microgreens. This will yield around 32 oz of greens which will serve around 32 people at once.</p>
      <p class= 'text-alignment-center' style="font-size:1.5vw">
e. How will you support your recommendations in your report? I would support these by bulding a small,simple system that is easy to maintain and within a budget of $500.The foundation of the space in my room was very flat which makes things easier. I would also be the only one working on this system so the system had to be manageable. The space also has an air conditioner, fans, and 2 windows to control temperature and air circulation.

      <h1>Project Analysis</h1>
      <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The strengths  of the location would be that my room would be the most accessible, affordable, and convenient. My budget did not allow for me to rent a a space to grow a large amount of crops. It is convenient because it is right in my room so I will be able to easily monitor its progress daily. </p>
      <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">The weaknesses of the location would be that it is a small space so walkways are narrow which could be a potential hazard. The outlets also could be a hazard if water gets in since they are not waterproof. There is also a low amount of light getting to the space. </p>
      <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">There were a few iterations of farm systems that I considered: </p>
      <h3>NFT system growing Mugwort and Clary Sage.</h3>
      <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">I made this system but did not think about the maximum growth height of the crops which was 3-6ft. This would be too heavy for the system and also the root spacing was around 2ft which made this system too small to accomodate the plants.</p>
      <img src="3D-NFT .png" alt="3D NFT" width="500" height="300" class="center">
      <h3>Deep Water Culture growing Mugwort and Clary Sage</h3>
      <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">This system was much simpler and could accomodate the plant height and the root spacing. However it was not going to yield as much and I realized that these plants take a couple of months to grow. </p>
      <img src="3D-DWC.png" alt="deep water culture" width="500" height="300" class="center">
      <h3>Flood Drain System growing Red Clover</h3>
      <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">This system was the most simple and easy to maintain. It would grow Red Clover microgreens and would yield around 32 oz of greens in 12 days which would serve around 32 people at once. The plant and the system was also much more compact for the space.</p>
      <img src="3D-FloodDrain.png" alt="flood drain system" width="500" class="center"> <a href="https://app.sketchup.com/share/tc/northAmerica/ODhw4pbGfFI?stoken=1SsoBaW6UMqbggRt0pZ5RpjsLU3cBUe0R_oZPV2sSj0kNau-f022xncWJ3yuhL4A&source=web" target="_blank">3D Flood and Drain</a> <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAF3cU8iY0w/8-r7E3WOOl_MqNBwE3psDA/view?utm_content=DAF3cU8iY0w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor" target= "_blank"> 2D Flood and Drain</a>
      <p class="text-alignment-center"> <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The concepts that Change Food for Good has taught me to apply to this case study has been the different kinds of hydroponics systems, lighting, nutrient solutions, water reservoir and aeration, maintenance of the systems, germination processes, pruning, and the different types of grow mediums. </p>

          <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw"> The biggest challenge I faced in the implementation of this project was looking at the exact amount of water that the coco coir should hold to grow red clover microgreens. Red Clover microgreens do not need a lot of water to grow and coco coir does hold water very well. Therefore I have to make sure the greens are not being overwatered which would lead to root rot.

      <h1 class='text-alignment-left'>Solutions</h1>
      <p class='text-alignment-left'style="font-size:1.5vw"> 
        The solutions to this challenge would be that I would have to check the humidity level daily and make sure that the coco coir is not overwatered. The fans would help as well to blow off any excess water as well as keep away pests and promote air circulation.

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">How would you improve upon your process in the future?</p>
        <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
        I would love to have a larger space, and to expand the amount of microgreens that can be grown. I would also love to use the blue LED growing lights because that would improve the yield and quality of the plant.</p>
        <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
        b. What should someone who's attempting to replicate your farm system know going into the project?</p>
        <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">For someone attempting to repllicate they should make sure not to overwater, check the humidity levels, lighting is important, and finally you must monitor the system daily.</p>
        <p class= "text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
        c. What were your biggest takeaways from this project?</p>
        <p class="text-alignment-center" style="font-size:1.5vw">
        My biggest takeaway is that hydroponics is an excellent way to grow food and there are many endless opportunities to improve!
